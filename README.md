# Marcus Portfolio 2023
This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences as of 2023. The portfolio site is designed to provide visitors with information about who I am, my educational background, previous work experiences, and a collection of my current portfolio projects.
